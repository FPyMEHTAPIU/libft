# Libft

This project involves creating my own library with representations of standard functions from the libc library and additional functions that are not in libc but are useful for working with linked lists represented as structs. The library is built using a Makefile from all the files in this project.

### Usage
To use this library, include "libft.h" in your code and link the created libft.a file when compiling your program.
