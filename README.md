<b><p>This is a project where I created my own library with representations of standard functions from libc and functions that are not in libc.</p>
<p>This library is created by Makefile from all the files in this project. In the future, it will be updated by adding new functions.</p>
<p>To use this library, you should include "libft.h" in your code and link the created libft.a file when compiling the program.</p></b>
